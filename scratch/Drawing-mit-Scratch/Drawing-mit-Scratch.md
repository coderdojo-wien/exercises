Challenge: Draw a two-dimensional figure using Scratch.

1. Draw a triangle
2. Draw a rectangle
3. Choose anything you would like to draw

Tools:

1. Malstift
2. The Scratch cat (or any other figure that will draw what you have chosen to draw)
3. Motion elements

Example:

The following code will produce this line:

![Linie](https://github.com/rigerta/exercise-docs/blob/Drawing-with-Scratch/linie.png?raw=true)

Use this example to build your own figure.

Can you draw a triangle?

Can you draw a rectangle?

Can you make it so that Scratch writes the line while moving, each step a segment?

Can you write it using less blocks? _(Hint: Use blocks from the Control tab)_
